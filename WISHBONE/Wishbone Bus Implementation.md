## Wishbone Bus Implementation

The WISHBONE System-On-Chip (SOC) Interconnection Architecture, also known as WISHBONE Bus, is a free, open-source standard that defines a common interface among IP Cores in a System-On-Chip. By doing so, it alleviates integration problems. That, in turn, encourages IP reuse which leads to improvements in the portability and reliability of the system and results in faster time-to-market for the end users.
WISHBONE is intended as a general-purpose portable interface that is independent of the underlying semiconductor technology. As such, its specification defines a set of signals and bus cycles but does not specify any electrical information nor enforce a bus topology. The WISHBONE bus uses a MASTER/SLAVE model of communication. In this model, the MASTER entities are capable of driving the bus by generating bus cycles, whereas SLAVES entities may only use the bus when instructed/inquired by a MASTER.

### Wishbone Interconnection (INTERCON)
The interconnection is the component responsible for tying all the various subcompo nents/entities, MASTERS and SLAVES, together in a manner that meets all communication and timing needs. Implementation requirements: - Uses a shared bus topology: Care must be taken so that just one participant drives the bus at any time.

- Based on multiplexers: One other tricky part of designing a shared bus inside an FPGA is that bus participants who are not driving the bus must neither drive a low nor a high signal on the bus. Typically, this is achieved by setting the signal drivers to a “High-Z” state, which means using Tri-State buffers. Since, normally, FPGAs do not have internal Tri-States buffers a switch logic based on multiplexers was implemented.
- 1 to N multiplexing (1 Masters, N Slaves): The facts that this is a single MASTER implementation and SLAVES may not use the bus when not addressed, the only care that must be taken is to not overlap the SLAVES memory maps.
- Partial address decoding: Each slave present in the bus has a corresponding entry in the memory map. Each of these entries consists of a base address (BASEADDR) and a size (SIZE). The SIZE corresponds to the effective number of addresses occupied by the slave, starting at the BASEADDR. In other words, this SIZE corresponds to the maximum OFFSET.
- The decoding process is done in two steps: The first step is done by comparators (one for each slave) implemented in this interconnection block. These comparators use the base address to select the slave or not. They do this by masking out the OFFSET bits of the address and then comparing base addresses. The masking out of the OFFSET bits is achieved using the SIZE. The second step is done by a fine decoder inside the selected slave. It will receive just the OFFSET and verify if it is valid.
- 
Using this decoding scheme has the drawback of imposing that the number of addresses used by the slaves must be a power of two, even when not all addresses are used. Hence, memory addresses can be wasted.
